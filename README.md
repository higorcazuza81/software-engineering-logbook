# Software Engineering Portfolio â€“ Higor Cazuza

## Professional Summary

Software engineer focused on building robust and scalable systems. This repository is the auditable and practical record of my continuous development, applying a systematic study methodology based on first principles and the canonical literature of software engineering. The objective is technical proficiency, validated through concrete and documented implementations.
