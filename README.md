# Software Engineering Logbook: A Proof of Work

This repository is the auditable record of my journey studying and applying the fundamentals of Software Engineering. The goal is not perfection, but the consistent demonstration of work (`Proof of Work`) and the pursuit of technical mastery.

## Methodology

Each directory represents a deep dive into a book or technology. The code is always accompanied by a local `README.md` that documents the concepts and solutions. **Writing is the final step to force the consolidation of knowledge.**
