# Pillar 1: Language Mastery

## Objective

To establish a deep, first-principles-based proficiency in the Python language. The focus is on producing idiomatic, performant, and robust code ready for complex production environments. This pillar serves as the foundation for all other software engineering competencies.

## Core Competencies

Through the studies and projects in this pillar, the following competencies are systematically developed and validated:

-   **Fundamentals & Data Structures:** Complete command of syntax, control flow, and native data structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets), including complexity analysis of their operations.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Class design, inheritance, composition, encapsulation, and polymorphism applied in practical projects.
-   **Testing & Code Quality:** Implementation of unit tests with `pytest` to ensure code correctness. Adherence to style and quality standards through linting and formatting with `Ruff`.
-   **Environment Management:** Creation and management of isolated virtual environments and project dependencies using `uv`.

## Proof of Work (Projects & Studies)

The following section documents the studies and practical application of these concepts. Each entry represents a project or an in-depth study of a canonical work in the field.

-   ### [Study: Python Crash Course](./python-crash-course/)
    -   **Description:** Systematic application of core Python concepts, from basic syntax to the implementation of three major projects: a 2D game with Pygame, data visualizations with Matplotlib/Plotly, and a web application with Django. The repository contains the solution to **all** exercises proposed in the book.
    -   **Status:** `In Progress`

-   ### [Study: Effective Python](link-to-future-folder)
    -   **Description:** Advanced study focused on writing high-quality, maintainable, and efficient Python code, covering topics such as concurrency, performance optimization, and robust metaprogramming.
    -   **Status:** `Planned`
