# Chapter 1: Environment Setup and Fundamentals

## Chapter Objective

To validate the development toolchain and execute the first script, establishing a functional baseline for all subsequent chapters.

## Technical Summary

-   **Virtual Environment:** An isolated environment was configured with `uv` using Python `3.12`.
-   **Validation (Smoke Test):** The `hello_world.py` script was used to confirm that the Python interpreter, VS Code, and associated extensions are correctly configured and integrated.
-   **Error Analysis (`SyntaxError`):** A `SyntaxError` was intentionally triggered to practice debugging skills. The traceback analysis allowed for the precise identification of:
    -   The exact file and line number of the error.
    -   The error type (`SyntaxError`).
    -   The specific cause (`unterminated string literal`), confirming the ability to diagnose syntax issues.

## File Structure
