# Python Crash Course: Study Log

This directory documents my systematic study journey through the book "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition" by Eric Matthes.

This work serves as the foundation for **Pillar 1: Python Mastery** of my self-directed Software Engineering curriculum. The methodology consists of reading each chapter, solving all proposed exercises, and recording each step as a versioned commit.

## Chapter Progress

The table below serves as both an index and a record of my progress. Each chapter has its own directory containing the exercise code and a dedicated `README.md` detailing the concepts learned.

| Chapter | Main Topic               | Status      |
