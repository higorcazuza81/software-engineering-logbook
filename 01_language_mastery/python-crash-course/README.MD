# Python Crash Course - Logbook

---

## Chapter 1: Getting Started

### Objective
The primary goal of this chapter is to establish a functional Python development environment and validate the complete "code-to-execution" pipeline. This involves ensuring the Python interpreter is correctly installed and accessible from the command line, and that a text editor is configured to create and run a basic script.

### Core Concepts Introduced
- **Python Interpreter:** The program that reads and executes Python code.
- **Terminal/Command Line:** The text-based interface for interacting with the system and running scripts.
- **Text Editor/IDE:** The tool used to write source code (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
- **Execution of a `.py` file:** The fundamental action of passing a source code file to the interpreter to be executed.

### Practical Implementation: `hello_world.py`
The canonical "Hello, World!" script was implemented to serve as a tangible proof of a successful setup. This simple one-line program confirms that all components of the environment are working in harmony.

- **Link to code:** [`ch01_getting_started/hello_world.py`](./ch01_getting_started/hello_world.py)

### Professional Insight: The "Smoke Test"
While trivial in its output, `hello_world.py` acts as a critical **smoke test** for a developer's environment. A successful execution is more than just printing a string; it's a confirmation that the foundational toolchain is robust. This simple validation prevents complex, hard-to-diagnose configuration issues in later, more sophisticated work. It represents the first and most fundamental step in ensuring a reliable development loop.
